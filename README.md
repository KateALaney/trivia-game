# Lord of the Rings Trivia Game

The following trivia game is based on the Lord of the Rings movies (not the original Tolkein books).  There are ten questions which ask players about features of the movies.  The player is given 20 seconds for each question.  Depending on whether the question selected is right or wrong, the player will receive a message telling them about their success or failure.  At the end of the game, the number of right and wrong questions are tallied and displayed to the player, and the player has the option to start the game over.
